   Did you know: You can use this plugin to also launch vistors into your own game server, or launch their game? Use the custom Server ShortCode - start it out with steam://rungameid/###//   (replace the ### with the game ID, which can be found by going here: https://steamdb.info/apps/   <--- and if the game supports parameters, you can even have the users launch right into your server, and launch with mods, etc...<br />
